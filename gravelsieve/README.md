# Gravel Sieve Mod
A Mod for those who do not want to spend half their lives underground...

This mod simplifies the extraction of ores by the fact that ores can be obtained simply by sieving gravel.

This mod includes three new tools:
 - a hammer to produce gravel from Cobblestone
 - two gravel sieves to find ores (a manual sieve and a automatic sieve)

### Dependencies
default, optional moreores, hopper, and pipeworks
