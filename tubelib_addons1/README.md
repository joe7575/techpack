the automated mining, farming, and crafting.

## Quarry

The Quarry digs a hole 5x5 nodes large and up to 25 nodes deep.
It starts at the given level (0 is same level as the quarry node,
1 is one level higher and so on)) and goes down to the given depth number.
It digs one node every 4 seconds. It requires one item Bio Fuel per 16 nodes.

## Harvester
Harvester machine to chop wood and leaves.  
The machine is able to harvest an square area of up to 41x41 nodes (radius = 20).
The base node has to be placed in the middle of the harvesting area.
The Harvester processes one node every 4 seconds. 
It requires one item Bio Fuel per 20 nodes.

## Grinder
The Grinder grinds cobble stone to gravel and is needed for the Gravelsieve Mod, to extract further ores from gravel.

## Autocrafter
Derived from the outstanding Pipeworks Mod, this block allows the automated crafting of items based on 
configured recipes.

## Fermenter
The Fermenter is able to obtain Bio Gas from any leaves (provided by the Harvester)
The Fermenter obtains one Bio Gas item every 4 seconds from 2 leave items.

## Reformer
The Reformer is able to generate one Bio Fuel item every 6 seconds from 4 Bio Gas items.
This Bio Fuel is needed by Quarry and Harvester.
